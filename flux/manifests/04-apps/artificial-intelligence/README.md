# Artificial Intelligence Applications

This directory contains AI and machine learning applications for the homelab infrastructure.

## Applications

### [OpenWebUI](./openwebui/README.md)

User-friendly web interface for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) through chat interfaces.

### [MLflow](./mlflow/README.md)

Open-source platform for the machine learning lifecycle with experiment tracking, model registry, and deployment capabilities.

### [MCP Servers](./mcp-servers/README.md)

Model Context Protocol servers providing specialized functionality for AI client integration.

## Overview

Artificial intelligence applications provide tools for:

- **LLM Interaction**: Web-based chat interfaces for language models
- **ML Lifecycle Management**: Experiment tracking, model registry, and deployment
- **MCP Integration**: Specialized servers for AI client functionality
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Security analysis through OSV database integration
- **Web Content Processing**: URL content retrieval and processing
- **Kubernetes Management**: Direct cluster access for AI-assisted operations

All applications are deployed via Flux GitOps and integrate with the homelab's authentication, monitoring, and gateway infrastructure.
