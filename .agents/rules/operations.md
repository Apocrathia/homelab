# Maintenance and Operations

- Schedule regular system updates.
- Verify backup and restore procedures (don't just trust they work — test them).
- Monitor system performance.
- Conduct periodic security reviews.
- Document operational procedures.
- Maintain system recovery plans.
- Keep inventory of hardware and software.

## Quality assurance during ops work

- Test changes in a safe manner.
- **Validate manifests locally as much as possible** before applying to cluster (`kubectl kustomize`, `helm template`, etc.).
- Maintain consistent standards across the project.
- Document testing procedures.
- Verify changes meet requirements.
- Have rollback plans for changes.
- **Do not alter the cluster without permission** — confirm before running any destructive commands.
