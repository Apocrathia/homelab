description: Security rules for the project
---
* On **any code change**, run the project's configured security tooling ASAP (secrets scan, SAST on changed files, dependency/manifest scan, and IaC checks when relevant).
* **Report findings immediately in-editor** with severity, file/line, and minimal repro.
* Apply **only** fixes explicitly recommended by the scanner that are **scoped to the current change**; list unrelated findings but **do not modify** code for them.
* After applying a fix, **re-scan** to verify the issue is resolved.
* If a tool errors or times out, **surface the error** and do not assume success.
* Prefer **incremental/fast scans** on save and **full scans** on pre-push.
* **After making changes in any package dependency/manifest files, scan the project for security vulnerabilities**
* Apply security fixes only according to the desired version reported by the scanner
* Re-scan after applying fixes to verify issues are resolved
