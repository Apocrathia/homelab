# General Guidelines for Homelab Development

## Project Structure
- Maintain a clear and logical directory structure
- Group related components and configurations together
- Keep configuration separate from application code
- Store alongside components and backlink to other docs
- Follow consistent naming conventions across the project

## Security Best Practices
- Never commit secrets or sensitive data to the repository
- Use a secure secrets management solution
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly audit security configurations
- Keep all components up to date with security patches

## Infrastructure Management
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles
- Document infrastructure dependencies
- Keep track of resource allocations
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Plan for system recovery scenarios

## Documentation Standards
- Well-structured with clear sections
- Concise but not minimal - include necessary technical details
- Practical and actionable
- Security-focused when appropriate
- Include real examples and commands
- Include configuration patterns, examples, and usage instructions
- Avoid duplicating static configuration values, but do include configuration patterns and examples

## Observability
- Implement comprehensive monitoring
- Establish logging standards
- Define alerting criteria
- Document metrics collection methods
- Monitor resource usage and performance
- Track system health indicators

## Development Workflow
- Use version control for all changes, with explicit approval from a human
- Test changes before applying to live system
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages
- Document breaking changes
- Keep track of dependencies and versions
- Maintain a clean and organized codebase

## GitOps Workflow
- While the project uses Flux for GitOps, iterative development may require direct cluster testing
- Have the user apply changes directly for testing when needed. Changes will be committed to the repository by the user.
- This balances development efficiency with GitOps principles

## Maintenance and Operations
- Schedule regular system updates
- Verify backup and restore procedures
- Monitor system performance
- Conduct periodic security reviews
- Document operational procedures
- Maintain system recovery plans
- Keep inventory of hardware and software

## Quality Assurance
- Test changes in a safe manner
- Validate configurations before deployment
- Maintain consistent standards across the project
- Document testing procedures
- Verify changes meet requirements
- Have rollback plans for changes

## MCP Tools Usage
- Use MCP tools when they provide value for the task at hand
- Use these tools naturally rather than forcing their usage
- Choose the most appropriate tool for the specific task rather than using all available tools
- Combine tools where beneficial
- Use local MCP tools over external model features when possible to optimize performance and cost
